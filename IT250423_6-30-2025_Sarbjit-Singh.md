Explanation:
The error "not enough memory" in Microsoft Excel on a Windows 11 laptop with Chrome and many open tabs is likely due to a combination of factors. Excel's memory usage, Chrome's memory consumption from numerous open tabs, and potentially a lack of available system memory can all contribute to this issue.
